### TOPIC

Global warming is one of the biggest problems we are facing now. Not only industrialized emission, agriculture and forest land emissions also play a big role in contributing to global warming by releasing greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2, CH4, N2O. 

### REASON

In this project, we will use Python, AWS, Postgress, and Excell to get the data cleaned and stored and subsequently create graphs and charts using pivot table .Then we’ll use Machine learning to analyze the emission data , and finally, visualize through Tableau. We’ll try to create a dashboard with JavaScript and use interactive buttons to see the change in emission in different location comparing with the population.


### Source of Data:

### QUESTIONS

1. What are the countries with the most emissions?

2. What are the items and elements contributing to emissions?

3. How has emission value changed over two decades?

4. Is there any relationship between emission and population?

5. Is there any relationship between development and emission?

6. What are the special measures taken by the least contributing countries towards emissions?
7. How can we categorize the countries by the range of emissions into red, yellow, and green zones?

8. How has emission increased or decreased over past 20 years?

9. How can Machine learning algorithms be used to predict the emissions for the future?

10. Which Machine Learning Model should be selected for the data analysis? Why?




TOOLs & SOFTWARE
### Python

· Most popular programming Language

· Code easy to write

· Performs complex calculations quickly

· Handles large Data Files

· Help to access, process, and manipulate data

### ETL

· To get consistent Data

· Reduce the time to do analysis with a robust data

### AWS

· Easily accessible data for all team members with updated version.

· The four basic functions of persistent data storage are Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)

### Postgress

· Import and export csv files, create tables with SQL

### Excell

· Interactive charts and graph with pivot chart

· Filters and conditional formatting

· Organize and visualize for trends

### Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to study complex environmental phenomena with high variability in time and space. In this study, the potential of exploiting three categories of ML regression models, including classical regression, shallow learning, and deep learning for predicting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agricultural field was explored. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, as well as various environmental, agronomic and soil data were measured at the site over a five-year period in Quebec, Canada. The rigorous analysis, which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of CO2 and N2O fluxes, confirmed that the LSTM(Long -Short Term Memory) model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest R coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values.

#### Tableau

· Powerful analytic dashboard to tell a story which is visually appealing and easy for anyone to understand.

### Javascript

· Create attractive, accessible, and interactive data with the help of button- and drop-down menus.

· Visualize the data to communicate findings to the audience



### All the Abbreviations Used:

UNFCCC: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

FAO: Food and Agricultural Organization () of United Nation

N2O: Nitrous Oxide

CH4: Methane

CO2: Carbon di Oxide

AFOLU: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

Fc: Calculated figure

### Reason for removing the columns

1. Fc: Calculated value. It’s not adding any information or data.

2. Source UNFCCC: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has negligible data to compare and account for.

3. All units are in Kilotons, hence removed the column.

### Negative Value

Some amount of released CO2 is again used in photosynthesis and some countries forestation or reduce in deforestation helps in removal of excessive CO2 in atmosphere.

### TABLEAU Pages
