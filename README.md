Machine Learning Model

To create a machine learning model, we first began by taking data after cleaning process. Next we are doing data preprocessing to feed the model and then starting with simple linear regression. Python and Sklearn will used to train/test our cleaned data. Once the data was trained it will be run through a model.
 
Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). The Regression models used for this project:
•	Gradient Boosting Regressor
•	Random Forest Regressor
•	Support Vector Machine
•	Decision Tree Regressor
